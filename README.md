# Space of solutions for a 2D RNN

Code to reproduce the 2D RNN part of the paper [Charting and Navigating the Space of Solutions for Recurrent Neural Networks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/d530d454337fb09964237fecb4bea6ce-Abstract.html)

The file `net_tanh4` contains the trained network params.

Two options to run the code:
1. Clone the repository locally. Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/KabirDabholkar/space-of-solutions-2D.git
